  <h2>Welcome to Letś Travel the World</h2>
  <p>By traveling- both within the USA and abroad- we expand our horizons and gain a greater appreciation of the world we live in.</p>
  
  <p>Experiencing othe cultures, including new food, languages, and customs, challenges us and makes us better understand our own culture.</p>
 
  <p>We are a full service travel agency. As seasoned travelers ourselves, we know what weŕe talking about and can draw upon our own experiences when putting together a great adventure for you and your family.</p>
  
<p> Once you've enjoyed a couple of great trips, you might just "catch the bug" like we did and start planning two or three trips ahead!</p>
  <p>Maybe you'll even put a big world map up on your wall at home and get out the color pushpin.</p>
  
  <p> so contact us today and let's start planning your next amazing trip!</p>
